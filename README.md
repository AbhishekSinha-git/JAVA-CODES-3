# JAVA-CODES-3

1. Class: In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

2. Constructor: A constructor is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.

3. Instance Variables (Fields): These are variables declared within a class but outside of any method. Each object of the class has its own copy of these variables.

4. Getter Methods: These are methods used to access the values of private instance variables from outside the class. In the Student class, getPrn(), getName(), getDob(), and getMarks() are getter methods.

5. ArrayList: ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface in Java. It allows dynamic resizing of the array as elements are added or removed.

6. Scanner: Scanner is a class in java.util package used for obtaining input from the user through various sources such as the keyboard.

7. try-catch Block: This is used for exception handling in Java. The code inside the try block is executed, and if any exception occurs, it is caught by the catch block, which handles the exception.

8. FileWriter: FileWriter is a class in Java used for writing character-oriented data to a file. It is used to create a file and write data to it.

9. IOException: IOException is a checked exception that indicates an error occurred while performing I/O operations such as reading from or writing to a file.

10. System.out.println(): This method is used to print the specified message to the standard output (usually the console).

11. ArrayList.add(): This method is used to add elements to an ArrayList.

12. ArrayList.remove(): This method is used to remove elements from an ArrayList.

13. Scanner.nextInt(): This method reads the next integer value from the input source (in this case, the keyboard).

14. Scanner.nextLine(): This method reads the next line of text from the input source (in this case, the keyboard).

15. FileWriter.write(): This method is used to write characters to a file.

16. FileWriter.close(): This method is used to close the file writer, flushing any buffered output streams.

These are the main functions, methods, and definitions used in the provided Java program. Each serves a specific purpose in achieving the functionality of the program.
